# Password Safe

Yet another? Yeah, indeed.

This is a simple, as secure as possible, quick, nifty project to store all my passwords, credit card details, what not PIIs I need to access every now and then, just a fingerprint away.

I trust no-one, least the big vendors (nor my self :) )
I don't want my sensitive data be whisked away to a cloud provider that forgot to encrypt the database, or change the DB default password or ..was just really lazy with keymanagement iterations and decided 64 is enough for everyone!
