Looks great ! https://developer.android.com/studio/test/other-testing-tools/app-crawler

In progress:

TODO:
- Backup codes - messes up notes
- phone numbers - handy when changing numbers
- username and password..often same, in some places separate ( banks!)
    - make a expandable box, where u can enter one detail (shared) or separately the both..
- dynamic folder for old passwords
- notify of old passwords
- not a password checkmark
- bonus card etc.number
- allow locking app ,but showing one field..if you want to hand the phone for someone else
- payment profile associated (just name,no card details)
- leak check by domain (just general info if site has had security incidents)
- if passkey??
- login via fb / google
- 2fa? Authenticator app?
- separate entity for security questions (treated like passwords)
- separate field for credit card details?
- generic expiration field(+notification x days before)
- add delete photo confirmation 
- or could security questions (which shouldn't exist!) Be more generic..anything..routing number,checking acct.with copy btn
- Family Passwords / shared passwords
- ellipsis cuts text too eagerly (password list left hand side)

- AutoFill - some support
- Accessibility - everything supports - but it is my responsibility to parse
- Keyboard integration v1 Pre Android 11
- Keyboard integration v2 Post Android 11
- Credentials Manager Api (14+ devices - no one supports)
